VPC exam tip:

think of VPC as a logical datacenter in AWS
consists of IGW's or virtual private gateways, route tables, netwirk access control list, subnets,security groups
1 subnets = 1 availability zone  so you can not span your subnet across multiple availability zones

security grups are stateful, network access control list are stateless
no transitive peering
