S3 security:

1 resource based policies:
  two types of resource based policies:
     Access control List
       grant read/write permission on objects and buckets to AWS account and predefined groups
       use an XML schema
       consist of a list of grants identifying the grantee and the permission
     bucket policies
        grant permission for the bucket and objects within to AWS account and IAM users
        expressed with JSON
        can be used to grant fine-granted permissions
        no applied by default

2 User policies:
  applied directly to users,groups or roles using AWS IAM. also managed in IAM
  can be used to grant fine-granted permission
  express using JSON
  cannot be used to grant anonymous access since they apply directly to users
  cannot grant to top user. such as root user.
  no applied by default
  can explicity deny access and grant additional permission and limited to 20KB


which polices should use?

in most cases, the prefered method of granting access is either via a user policy or bucket policy as these are able to grant much finer permissions than ACL's
the choice of which to use is really down to personal preference

however, there are siturations in which certain policies must be used:
 ACL's
   to manage access to objects not owned by the bucket owner
   to manage access to individual objects when permissions must vary between objects
   to grant permission to the 'S3 log delivery group' on a bucket
 bucket's
   to grant cross account access permissions that can't be granted via an ACL


ACL note:

grant to bucket or objects, can be used only to grant permission to AWS account and pre-defined group
can only grant basic read/write permission
can not grant conditional or deny permission

ACL Features:
  defined using XML
  
canned ACL are commonly used when using the CLI
the following is some canned ACL list:
1 private      owner get full control,no access to anyone else
2 public-read  owner get full control, the allusers group gets read
3 public-read-write owner get full control, the allusers group gets read and write
4 aws-exec-read   owner get full control,aws EC2 get read access to get an AMI from S3
5 authenticated-read  owner get full control, authenticate user group get read
6 bucket-owner-read   object owner get full control, the bucket owner get read
7 bucker-owner-full-control, object and bucker owner get full contrl
8 log-delivery-write   the logdelivery group gets write and read_acp access to the bucket

for example:
aws s3 cp a.txt s3://xxxxx/xxxx --acl public-read


bucket or user based policy:
policy elements:
1 principle: the account or user that is allowed or deny access to the resources specified in the statement
  only applied in bucket policy
  specified as a name/value pair
  
2 effect-- the effect taken when the user requests the action. either "allow" or "deny"
3 action-- the list of permission to allow or deny
4 resource--the bucker or object for which the access applies to. specified as ARN amazon resource name
5 sid-- not required for S3. generally used as a description of the policy statement
Note: user policies do not have a principle in the statement because the principle is the user whom executes the policy

grant fine grained access:
48 permission in total covering objects,buckets and subresources


condition permission:
additional, optional policy elements that allow you to specify the condition for when a policy is in place
example:
allow a user to put an object but only if the object is uploaded with S3 encryption enabled
allow user to delete an object but only if they use multi-factor authentication to do so
allow user to create a bucket but only in a specified region
